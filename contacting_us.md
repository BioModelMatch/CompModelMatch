# Contacting us

## Mailing lists

We have a number of ways you can contact us. If your query or feedback is of a non confidential nature, we would prefer that you
contact us through our Google group lists. This means in the future your query and the answer could be helpful to others, and also a response is likely to be quicker.

The groups are open to anonymous queries, you don't have to be a group member to submit a query.

We have two groups:

* For technical or development related queries please use [SEEK Developers Group](http://groups.google.com/group/seek-developers)
* For general queries, or queries about using SEEK please us [Seek4Science Group](http://groups.google.com/group/seek4science)


## Contact form

You can also contact us through [FAIRDOM](http://fair-dom.org) using our [Contact form](http://fair-dom.org/contact).
This should be used if your query or feedback is of a more confidential nature. Remember to provide your email address.


## Reporting bugs and feature requests

You can report bugs or request new features using the Google groups described above, or using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/issues).

When reporting your request please provide a clear description of the problem or new feature. In particular for bugs,
please provide as much information as possible about your setup, SEEK version and the steps required to reproduce the bug.
