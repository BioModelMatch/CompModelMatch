# JERM Templates

SysMO-DB, the SysMO-PALs and other members of the SysMO consortium have been developing a collection of JERM templates to facilitate standard formats for sharing the same kinds of data through the consortium. This page lists the current templates available.

#### SOPs

* [Nature Protocols Format for SOPs](attachments/NatureProtocolsFormat.doc)

#### Data

* [Master Template](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/927)  

This is the general format for all SEEK templates. Each spreadsheet has multiple sheets, defining experimental metadata, organims/samples, data and optional sheets for instrument descriptions and results.  
This template can be refined and/or extended to cater more specifically for different data types.

##### Metabolomics

* [Master Metabolomics Template](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/927)

This is a JERM compliant template for general use in metabolomics experiments

##### Transcriptomics

###### General Transcriptomics Templates

* [General Chip-chip Array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/931)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

* [RT-PCR](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/930)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]

* [Gene Expression ArrayExpress](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/8)  
A JERM compliant template based on the MAGE-TAB ArrayExpress format (metadata only)  

###### Affymetrix

* [3â€™ or Whole Gene Expression array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/928)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

* [Chip-chip Array](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/929)  
A JERM compliant template for Chip-chip data based on a template taken from [GEO][3]

###### Nimblegen

* [Gene Expression](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/933)  
A JERM compliant template based on a template taken from [GEO][3]  

##### Proteomics

* [Mass Spec JERM](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/932)  
This MIAPE template was adapted from a template offered by the [PRIDE database][5] to conform to the SEEK JERM format. For proteomics data, the "Instrument" sheet is mandatory.

* [Gel Electrophoresis](https://fairdomhub.org/data_files/938)  
This is a MIAPE-GE template for use with 2D gel data
