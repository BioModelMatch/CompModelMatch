# Docker



## Installing Docker

As a miminum you will need the Docker Engine. 

For details on how to install on a number of platforms please read 
the [Docker Engine Install Guides](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Optionally, for larger deployments you will also need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), 
which also provides an [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
