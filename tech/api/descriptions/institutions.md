An **Institition** in SEEK is where someone is employed or works. It is normal for an **Institution** to have a physical location - a set of buildings in which **People** work.

SEEK does not impose any constraints on the granularity of the **Institution** so it may represent a whole university or company, or be limited to a specific site.
