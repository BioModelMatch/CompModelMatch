An **Institition** in SEEK is where someone is employed or works. It is normal for an **Institution** to have a physical location - a set of buildings in which [**People**](#tag/people) work.

SEEK does not impose any constraints on the granularity of the **Institution** so it may represent a whole university or company, or be limited to a specific site.

An **Institution** has the following associated information:

* **The title of the Institution**
* A reference to an avatar / logo for the **Institution**
* The two letter country code
* The name of the city where the **Institution** has its headquarters
* The address of the **Institution** within the city
* A URI to the webpage for the **Institution**

A response for an **Institution** such as that for a [**Create**](#tag/create), [**Read**](#tag/read) or [**Update**](#tag/update) includes the additional information

* References to registered [**People**](#tag/people) who work at the **Institution**
* References to the [**Projects**](#tag/projects) in which the **Institution** is a partner.
