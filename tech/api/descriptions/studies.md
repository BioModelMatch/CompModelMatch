A **Study** is a series of experiments (or [**Assays**](#tag/assays) ) which can be combined to answer a particular biological question. These experiments might be a series of the same type of [**Assay**](#tag/assays) (for example, microarrays for different conditions), or they may be a collection of different types of [**Assay**](#tag/assays) (e.g. a combination of array and mass spec measurements).
