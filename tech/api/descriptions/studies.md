A **Study** is a series of experiments (or [**Assays**](#tag/assays) ) which can be combined to answer a particular biological question. These experiments might be a series of the same type of [**Assay**](#tag/assays) (for example, microarrays for different conditions), or they may be a collection of different types of [**Assay**](#tag/assays) (e.g. a combination of array and mass spec measurements).

A **Study** has the following associated information:

* **The title of the Study**
* A description of the **Study**
* A string listing experimentalists of the **Study**
* A string listing other creators of the **Study**
* A string containing the id of the [**Person**](#tag/people) responsible for the **Study**
* The sharing **Policy** of the **Study**
* References to the [**People**](#tag/people) who created the **Study**
** A reference to the [Investigation](#tag/investigations) containing the Study**
* References to [**Publications**](#tag/publications) about the **Study**

A response for a **Study** such as that for a [**Create**](#tag/create), [**Read**](#tag/read) or [**Update**](#tag/update) includes the additional information

* A reference to the [**Person**](#tag/people) who registered (submitted) the **Study** into SEEK
* References to the [**Projects**](#tag/projects) that indirectly contain the **Study**
* References to the [**Assays**](#tag/assays) that belong to the **Stuady**
* References to [**DataFiles**](#tag/dataFiles) that belong to the **Study**
