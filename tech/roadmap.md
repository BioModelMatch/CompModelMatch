# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.


| Feature | Milestone date |
| --- | --- |
| Full integration with openBIS | Winter 2017  |
| Application Programming Interface (API) supporting writes | Summer 2017  |
