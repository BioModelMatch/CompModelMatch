# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| New user-interface based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) | July 2015  |
| Self management of organisms | August 2015  |
| Improved registration workflow | October 2015  |
| Self management of projects and programmes | October 2015  |
| Support for [Research Objects](http://www.researchobject.org/) | October 2015 |
| LDAP support for authentication | TBA  |
| Improved Samples/Treatments/SOP handling | January 2016  |
