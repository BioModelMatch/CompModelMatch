# Generic linking variables in SEEK

## Title
You should make titles as descriptive as possible.

## Description
The description allows you to further expand important details.

## Projects
Assets can be assigned to projects in which they were created using the drop down menu.
![add project 1](/images/user-guide/add_project_1.png)

You can remove any selected projects using the remove button.

## Investigation details

## Study
[Assay specific] You can link an assay to a particular study within your projects using the drop down menu.

## Biological Problem Addressed
[Assay specific - modelling analysis] You can select which biological problem is addressed with the modelling analysis using the drop down menu. You can also add you own using the new modelling analysis type button.

## Assay Type
[Assay specific - experimental assay]
You can select an assay type from the drop down menu, or where appropriate create a new assay type using the new assay type button.

## Technology Type
[Assay specific - experimental assay]
You can select a technology type from the drop down menu, or where appropriate create a new technology type using the new technology type button.

## Organism
[Assay specific]
You can select an organism from the drop down menu.

![organism 1](/images/user-guide/organism_1.png)

## Experimentalists


## Sharing
SEEK has fine grained sharing permissions. You can choose to share an asset in SEEK with just you, selected people within and outside of SEEK, your whole project, or publicly.

## Tags
Tags are key words that are relevant in some way to the asset and its properties. They are used so relevant assets can be found more easily by other users using key-word searches. To incude a tag you just type it into the box. Suggestions of tags will appear in a drop down menu as you type. You are free to use any free text for tags.

## Attributions
An attribution in SEEK allows you, where appropriate, to select the asset from which your asset was derived from (stored within SEEK). As you type in the attribution, related assets will appear in a drop down menu.

![add tags 1](/images/user-guide/add_attribution_1.png)

## Contributors
Contributors are others who have been involved in generating the asset, through for example planning, experimentation, or analysis.

![add contributor 1](/images/user-guide/add_contributor_1.png)

You can add multiple contributors, either one by one.

![add contributor 1](/images/user-guide/add_contributor_1.png)

or using the add multiple project members tab, where you select members of a specific project to add.

![add project members 1](/images/user-guide/add_project_members_1.png)

You can choose to add all member of a project, or members of a project from a specific institution.

![add project members 2](/images/user-guide/add_project_members_2.png)

You can also include non-SEEK creators.

You can also add non-SEEK contributors using free text.

![add non-SEEK contributors 1](/images/user-guide/add_nonseek_contributors_1.png)

Contributors can be removed easily where necessary.

## SOPs
[Assay specific]
SOPs are standard operating procedures which describe the protocol required to reproduce the assay. They can be in any format (word files, e-lab notebooks, code, annotated spreadsheets etc). Relevant SOPs can be linked directly to the assay via the dropdown menu.

## Data Files
[Assay specific]
Data files can be any file containing data relevant to the assay (raw data, processed data, callibration information etc). They can be in any format (word files, e-lab notebooks, code, annotated spreadsheets etc). Relevant data files can be linked directly to the assay via the dropdown menu.

## Publications
If your asset is directly related to a publication you can link the two together in SEEK. You can select publications within your project form the drop-down menu. If the publication is in another project you need to check the box that says associate publications from other projects.

![add publication 1](/images/user-guide/add_publication_1.png)

When a publication is added a preview will be shown in the bottom right hand corner of SEEK. It can be removed easily if needed.

![add publication 2](/images/user-guide/add_publication_2.png)

## Experimental assays and Modelling analysis
It is best that assets are contextualised using the ISA graph (more later). This means that assets where possible should be linked to an assay or an experimental analysis. This can be done by selecting an appropriate assay or experimental analysis from the drop down menu.

![add assay 1](/images/user-guide/add_assay_1.png)

An assay preview will appear on the right hand side of SEEK once selected. The linking can be removed from the asset easily.

![add assay 2](/images/user-guide/add_assay_2.png)

## Experimental assays and modelling analysis

## Events
If the asset was generated as part of an event that is registered in SEEK, you can link to the asset to the event using the drop down menu.

![add event 1](/images/user-guide/add_event_1.png)

A preview of the event will appear on the right hand side of SEEK once selected. The link can be removed from the asset easily.
