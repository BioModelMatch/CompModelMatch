## Asset housekeeper
The Asset Housekeeper has the special ability to manage assets belonging to other people in the project â€“ but only people who have been flagged as having left the project. It is useful to prevent items being "stranded" when somebody leaves a project, but without handing over their assets from the project to be managed by other users.

## Asset gatekeeper
This is an optional role which allows a specific user or users to have control over whether assets within the project are can be made public. Whenever a project item is made public or published, it will not become available until the Asset Gatekeeper has approved it. The Asset Gatekeeper is notified when an asset is pending publication. It acts as a way of preventing pre-published items becoming publicly available to soon.

## Project administrator
The Project Administrator gets notified when someone new signs up to the project within SEEK. They also have the ability to:

* [Add and remove people from a project](#add-and-remove-people-from-a-project)

* [Create Institutions](#create-institutions)
* [Assign people to project roles](#assign-people-to-project-roles)
